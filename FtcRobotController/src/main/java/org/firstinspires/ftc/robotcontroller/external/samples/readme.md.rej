 ## Caution
 No Team-specific code should be placed or modified in this ``.../samples`` folder.
 
-Full or partial Samples should be Copied from here, and then Pasted into
-the team's folder, using the Android Studio cut and paste commands.
-This automatically changes all file and class names to be consistent.

 ### Naming of Samples
 
 To gain a better understanding of how the samples are organized, and how to interpret the
 naming system, it will help to understand the conventions that were used during their creation.
 
 These conventions are described (in detail) in the sample_conventions.md file in this folder.
 
 To summarize: A range of different samples classes will reside in the java/external/samples.
 The class names will follow a naming convention which indicates the purpose of each class.
 The prefix of the name will be one of the following:
 
 Basic:  	This is a minimally functional OpMode used to illustrate the skeleton/structure
             of a particular style of OpMode.  These are bare bones examples.
 
 Sensor:    	This is a Sample OpMode that shows how to use a specific sensor.
             It is not intended to drive a functioning robot, it is simply showing the minimal code
             required to read and display the sensor values.
 
 Hardware:	This is NOT an OpMode, but a helper class that is used to describe
             one particular robot's hardware configuration:   eg: For the K9 or Pushbot.
             Look at any Pushbot sample to see how this can be used in an OpMode.
             Teams can copy one of these to their team folder to create their own robot definition.
 
 Pushbot:	This is a Sample OpMode that uses the Pushbot robot hardware as a base.
